# todoey_flutter

its an small app that dealing with the lists that you want to do every day so you can write it in this app and when you finish one task u can click on the box,
that you done with it or u can remove it by clicking along click and it will be removed............its beautiful ui that i hope u like it with mix with colors,
First i used Callbacks to to get some futures done but when the code and the app gets bigger the more complexity shown so i used "Provider" package,
and it was very useful and easy to deal with it................i hope to like it.
